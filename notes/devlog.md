# Tue 7th Jan

Start of this little experimental project.

Just going to mess around and create some components.

## Ideation

Getting inspiration from here: https://flowbite-svelte.com/

The device mockup component on there is quite cool. You can provide it a screenshot of your app and it appears
on a mockup of a device such iOS, android, laptop.

### List of components

- Accordion
- Alert
- Avatar
- Badge
- Banner
- Bottom Navigation (mobile)
- Breadcrumb
- Button Group
- Buttons
- Cards
- Carousel
- Checkbox
- Datepicker
- Drawer (modal coming out from side)

### Nav

- logo
- search

## 7 GUIs

Following https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/, I'm going to try and make some GUIs. There is a great person on youtube called Joy Of Code who [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afLUZz_7ySc&list=PLA9WiRZ-IS_zU2j29HQy478UCuHyDZQXC&index=6&t=626s) on it.

## Auth

Just used the inbuilt [lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) authentication and customised the app such that all
routes are protected with auth by default. Was relatively painless to adapt.
